  "summary": "The diff implements the majority of the 14 requirements including all 8 page components, global design system, navbar/footer, routing (via TanStack Router instead of React Router), backend Motoko actor, custom cursor, page load animation, GlassCard, scroll reveal, dark/light theme, and most visual features. Several specific requirements are partially or potentially missing based on the truncated diff evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "All routing must be client-side React Router (react-router-dom). The implementation uses @tanstack/react-router instead.",
      "reason": "The build request explicitly requires 'All routing is client-side React Router; no server-side rendering' and REQ-12 specifies React Router-based routing. The diff uses @tanstack/react-router throughout App.tsx and all page components.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Hero right side should have an abstract 3D-style tech visual (Three.js scene with floating geometric shapes or animated SVG). The parallax hero right side appears to use only CSS-animated border circles and particle dots, not a Three.js scene.",
      "reason": "The spec explicitly requests a Three.js scene or animated SVG on the right side of the hero. The diff shows only CSS circles and floating dots with no Three.js import or canvas element.",

        "frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx"

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "The About page team section should include 6 portrait placeholders. The diff only defines 5 team members (team-1 through team-5).",
      "reason": "REQ-14 and REQ-5 both require 6 team portrait placeholders. The About.tsx team array only has 5 entries.",

      "requirement": "Gallery category filter should include All, Events, Products, Office per the spec. The diff implements an extra Webinars category not in the spec for Gallery.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Backend actor should use a stable array or stable HashMap for persistence across upgrades.",
      "reason": "The Motoko actor uses 'let contactList = List.empty()' and 'var nextId = 0' without the 'stable' keyword, which means state will not persist across canister upgrades as required.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Smooth page transitions — fade or slide between routes (300ms ease-in-out) should be implemented for route changes.",
      "reason": "The diff shows page-fade-in class applied per page but no route-change transition orchestration wrapper is visible. No animated transition component bridging route changes is shown.",
